# Changelog

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- CuktechConnectionSwitch: BLE enable/disable control via HTTP API
- CuktechConnectionBinarySensor: BLE connection status display
- async_enable_ble with asyncio.Lock, 30s timeout, optimistic state
- ble_enabled synced with ble_connected from MQTT status
- Switch available property includes ble_pending check
- ConfigFlow default name updated to full product name

### Fixed
- BLE connection stability: power cycle LL disconnect wait, GATT settle time
- NoneType errors: null checks for self.ctrl in main loop and handlers
- handle_enable(false): await ble_task before power cycle to prevent race
- controller: start_notify wrapped in try/except for partial failure

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Real entity class unit tests (30 tests for Sensor/Switch/BinarySensor/Select/Number)
- ConfigFlow tests: async_step_user form/create/unique_id/errors/abort
- Coordinator tests: async_set_value, async_port_control with payload verification
- MQTT LWT (Last Will and Testament) for crash detection
- async_will_remove_from_hass super() calls on all entities
- _notify_callbacks iterates list copy to prevent mutation during iteration

### Fixed
- Availability logic: HTTP failure respects MQTT connected state
- MQTT `connected: false` no longer falsely marks device available
- Duplicate entities: removed PIID 19/20 from SENSOR_PIIDS (already in SETTING_PIIDS)
- MQTT publish error handling: async_set_value/port_control wrapped in try/except
- Config flow error messages now use HA translation keys
- test_health_failures renamed to match actual assertion
- conftest.py: real HA base classes for proper @property support

### Changed
- BLE module split: ble.py → protocol.py + controller.py + cli.py
- CORS restricted to localhost origins only
- Removed unused PUT/DELETE from CORS allowed methods

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- HACS support for easy installation
- My Home Assistant badges for one-click integration setup
- Bilingual README (Chinese/English) with language switcher

### Fixed
- ConfigEntry import missing in sensor.py
- MQTT port command missing cmd_future
- Multiframe data handling
- History data retention (default 2 days)
- Chart data alignment between frontend and backend
- Exponential backoff for BLE reconnection

### Changed

- Health check interval increased to 30 seconds
- MQTT reconnection uses exponential backoff (1s→30s)
- SQLite writes use threading.Lock for thread safety
